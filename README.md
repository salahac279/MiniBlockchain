# MiniBlockchain
# Simple Blockchain in C++

This is a basic blockchain implementation in C++ using SHA-256 hashing for security and a Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism for mining. Each block contains a transaction, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block's hash, ensuring an immutable chain.

## Features

- Implements SHA-256 hashing for block security
- Proof-of-Work (PoW) system to validate new blocks
- Transaction structure to store sender, receiver, and amount
- Blockchain validation to check integrity after adding blocks
- Genesis block (first block in the chain)
